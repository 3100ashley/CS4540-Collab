# Mark My Words

## Summary 
Mark My Words is a Mozilla browser extension that allows users to highlight text and take notes as they read. All highlighted text and notes will be saved to the web page or PDF. This extension is great for students or those who like to read on the web because it allows them to annotate on the same page they are reading on instead of writing notes on a separate document. We will create a menu component. This will appear when the user right clicks on a selected piece of text. Within the menu component we will create different highlighter color options and the option to take notes or annotate. We will also be working with a database where we will store the users highlighted text and notes. We may have some issues saving the users information to the database or there might be limited storage. We may have to limit the number of web pages or the amount of storage a user can use to highlight and create notes.
