* To do list extension

## Future Meetings
Future meetings will be held online or after class in the school library and we will be collaborating our work on Github. 
Each team member is responsible for understanding the tech stack and asking for help when needed. 
We will make decisions by voting or evaluating which ideas are within our capacity to create within the given time frame.
